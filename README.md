# Applying Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm to Classify Yelp Sentimental Review Comments

This project aims to build the sentimental classifier with accuracy higher than 80% using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. We will compare the probability for a word and if the proability of a positive category is greater than the one of a negative category, then this word will be classified as a positive word. By combining all proabilities of words within a sentence/comment, we will get the whole comment proability and be able to identify the sentimental categories (positive or negative).

The data used in this study is from https://www.kaggle.com/rahulin05/sentiment-labelled-sentences-data-set .

Note that this project is inspired by one of the Guided Projects of DataQuest.
